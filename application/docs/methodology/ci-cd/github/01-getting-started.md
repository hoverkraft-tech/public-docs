# Getting Started with GitHub Actions CI/CD

Set up CI/CD for your project using GitHub Actions and Hoverkraft reusable workflows. The pattern works for single applications, monorepos, and containerized services alikeâ€”adjust the working directory and build steps to match your stack.

## What You'll Build

âœ… Automated testing on pull requests  
âœ… Automated builds on commits  
âœ… On-demand deployments (review apps via `/deploy` comments, production via manual release workflow)  
âœ… Community automation (semantic PR titles, greetings, stale issues)  
âœ… Security scanning via the shared CI workflow

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository (public or private) containing your application code
- Deterministic build/test commands (Makefile targets, package scripts, or similar)
- Ability to configure workflow inputs for your stack (working directory, runtime version, artifacts)
- Basic Git/GitHub knowledge
- ~30-60 minutes

## CI/CD Overview

**Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically builds, lints, and checks code on every change  
**Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Deploys once you trigger itâ€”either `/deploy` for review apps or a manual release workflow after CI succeeds

## Hoverkraft Approach

Pre-built, reusable workflows that:

- Centralise CI logic in `__shared-ci.yml` so every workflow reuses the same jobs
- Enforce best practices (version pinning, minimal permissions)
- Stay updated through Dependabot (actions, runtimes, base images)

## Tutorial Steps

1. **Project Structure** - Repository layout
2. **Core Workflows** - Essential CI/CD
3. **Community Workflows** - Optional automation
4. **Deployment** - On-demand deployment flows
5. **Testing** - Verification
6. **Best Practices** - Tips and guidelines

Follow steps in order for best results.
