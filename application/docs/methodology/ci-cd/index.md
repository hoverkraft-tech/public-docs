# CI/CD Overview

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are essential practices for modern software development. This section provides comprehensive guides for implementing CI/CD pipelines following Hoverkraft best practices.

## What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of automatically building and testing code changes as they are committed to version control. This ensures that new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase and meets quality standards.

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** automatically deploys code that passes all tests to production or staging environments, enabling rapid and reliable releases.

## Why CI/CD Matters

### Benefits

1. **Early Bug Detection**: Automated tests catch issues before they reach production
2. **Faster Release Cycles**: Automated deployment eliminates manual steps
3. **Improved Code Quality**: Consistent checks ensure standards are met
4. **Reduced Risk**: Small, frequent changes are easier to debug and rollback
5. **Developer Productivity**: Automation frees developers to focus on features
6. **Consistent Deployments**: Automated processes eliminate human error

### Hoverkraft Approach

The Hoverkraft CI/CD methodology focuses on:

- **Reusability**: Share workflows across projects
- **Standardization**: Common patterns for similar project types
- **Security**: Built-in scanning and best practices
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and maintain
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to different project needs

## Platform Guides

### GitHub Actions

Our most comprehensive CI/CD guide covers GitHub Actions from basic setup to advanced deployment strategies:

This step-by-step tutorial includes:

- Getting started guide for beginners
- Project structure requirements
- Core and community workflows
- Deployment setup
- Testing and troubleshooting
- Best practices and reference documentation

## Hoverkraft CI/CD Ecosystem

Hoverkraft provides several repositories with reusable workflows and actions:

### Core Repositories

   - Semantic PR validation
   - Community management
   - Issue automation

2. **[ci-github-nodejs](https://github.com/hoverkraft-tech/ci-github-nodejs)** - Node.js specific workflows
   - Complete CI pipeline
   - Build, test, and artifact management
   - Security scanning

3. **[ci-github-container](https://github.com/hoverkraft-tech/ci-github-container)** - Container workflows
   - Docker image building
   - Multi-platform support
   - Registry publishing

4. **[ci-github-publish](https://github.com/hoverkraft-tech/ci-github-publish)** - Publishing actions
   - GitHub Pages deployment
   - Artifact publishing

5. **[compose-action](https://github.com/hoverkraft-tech/compose-action)** - Docker Compose integration
   - Service orchestration in CI
   - Automatic cleanup

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Pull Request Workflow

```
PR opened â†’ CI runs â†’ Tests pass â†’ Review â†’ Merge â†’ Deploy
```

1. Developer creates a pull request
2. CI workflow automatically triggers
3. Code is built and tested
4. Security scans run
5. Review process begins
6. After approval and merge, trigger the release workflow to deploy

### Main Branch Workflow

```
Commit to main â†’ CI runs â†’ Tests pass â†’ Build artifacts â†’ Deploy
```

1. Code is merged to main branch
2. Full CI pipeline executes
3. Build artifacts are created
4. On-demand release workflow pushes to production
5. Monitoring and verification

## Getting Started

1. **Review the [GitHub Actions Tutorial](./github/)** for detailed implementation steps
2. **Choose appropriate reusable workflows** for your project type
3. **Customize and implement** in your repository
4. **Test thoroughly** before enabling release workflows

## Best Practices

### Security

- Always pin workflow versions with SHA
- Use minimal required permissions
- Scan dependencies and code for vulnerabilities
- Protect sensitive data with secrets

### Performance

- Cache dependencies when possible
- Use concurrency controls to cancel redundant runs
- Run independent jobs in parallel
- Optimize test execution time

### Maintainability

- Keep workflows simple and focused
- Use reusable workflows to avoid duplication
- Document custom logic and decisions
- Version pin with comments for tracking

### Testing

- Test locally before committing
- Use branch protection rules
- Require status checks before merging
- Implement comprehensive test coverage

## Support and Resources

- **Documentation**: Each CI/CD repository has detailed documentation
- **Examples**: Real-world implementations in Hoverkraft projects
- **Community**: [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/hoverkraft-tech/discussions)
- **Issues**: Report problems in respective repositories
