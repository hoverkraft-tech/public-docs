# Hoverkraft Methodology

Welcome to the Hoverkraft methodology documentation. This section provides comprehensive guides on best practices, standards, and recommended approaches for building and maintaining software projects using the Hoverkraft ecosystem.

## What is the Hoverkraft Methodology?

The Hoverkraft methodology is a collection of proven practices, tools, and workflows designed to help teams build high-quality software efficiently. It emphasizes:

- **Modularity**: Reusable components and workflows
- **Consistency**: Standardized approaches across projects
- **Automation**: Minimize manual tasks through CI/CD
- **Quality**: Built-in checks and best practices
- **Security**: Security-first approach in all aspects
- **Community**: Open-source collaboration and transparency

## Documentation Sections

### CI/CD

Learn how to implement continuous integration and continuous deployment using modern DevOps practices:

- **[GitHub Actions](./ci-cd/github/)**: Step-by-step tutorial for structuring CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, including comprehensive guides from getting started to deployment and troubleshooting.

## Key Principles

### 1. Infrastructure as Code

All infrastructure and deployment configurations should be version-controlled and reproducible.

### 2. Automated Testing

Every project should have automated tests that run on every change, ensuring quality and preventing regressions.

### 3. Continuous Integration

All code changes should be integrated frequently and validated automatically through CI pipelines.

### 4. Continuous Deployment

Successful builds on the main branch should be automatically deployed to appropriate environments.

### 5. Security by Default

Security scanning and best practices should be built into every workflow, not added as an afterthought.

### 6. Documentation

All projects should have clear, up-to-date documentation that includes setup instructions, architecture decisions, and contribution guidelines.
