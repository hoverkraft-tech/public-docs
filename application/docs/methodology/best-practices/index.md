# Best Practices

Hoverkraft best practices centralize the opinionated guidance that shows up across our templates, reusable workflows, and golden paths. Use this section to align teams on shared defaults and to avoid duplicating recommendations in multiple docs.

## How to use this section

1. **Start here** to understand the recommended defaults.
2. **Follow the links** to the detailed implementations in golden paths and reusable workflow docs.
3. **Reference instead of duplicating**: when you document a best practice elsewhere, point back to this section.

## Topics

- **[DevX coding rules](./devx-coding-rules.md)** — Conventional commits, atomic changes, and semantic releases
- **[GitHub Actions & workflow practices](./github-actions.md)** — Secure, maintainable, and cache-aware workflows
- **[Dockerfile + BuildKit/Buildx](./docker-buildkit-buildx.md)** — Fast, reproducible image builds with caching and security defaults
- **[Helm charts](./helm-chart.md)** — Chart structure, values hygiene, and release discipline
