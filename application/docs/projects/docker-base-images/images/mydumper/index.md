# mydumper

The goal of this container is to simplify the use of mydumper with velero for automating backups of MySQL databases

## Usage

To use the image, you can pull it from the [OCI registry](https://github.com/orgs/hoverkraft-tech/packages/container/package/docker-base-images%2Fmydumper).

- `/entrypoint.sh` is run at the container startup and creates dumps in `/backups` with a timestamped directory
- `KEEP_BACKUPS` backuos are kept at the same time to avoid filling up `/backups`
