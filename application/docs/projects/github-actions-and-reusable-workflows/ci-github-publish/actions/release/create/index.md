| **`release-artifact-id`** | Optional workflow artifact ID containing files to upload as GitHub release assets after the draft release is created or updated.                                                            | **false**    | -                     |
|                           | The artifact is downloaded automatically before upload.                                                                                                                                     |              |                       |
|                           | Prefer `actions/release/update` when you only need to mutate an existing release.                                                                                                           |              |                       |
| **`publish`**             | Whether to publish the release after changelog and asset updates succeed.                                                                                                                   | **false**    | `true`                |
|                           | When disabled, the release remains a draft.                                                                                                                                                 |              |                       |

## Outputs

| **Output** | **Description**        |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| **`tag`**  | The tag of the release |

<!-- outputs:end -->

This action creates or refreshes the release as a draft first, then publishes it by default after all requested summary and asset updates succeed. Set `publish` to `false` to keep the release as a draft.

When `changelog-summary` is provided, the action summarizes the drafted changelog body with [release/summarize-changelog](../summarize-changelog/index.md) and prepends the generated summary above the drafted release notes.

When `release-artifact-id` is provided, the action uploads the downloaded artifact files as release assets during release creation or refresh.

For mutating an existing release after creation, prefer [release/update](../update/index.md).
